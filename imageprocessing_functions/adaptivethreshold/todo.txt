//The function transforms a grayscale image to a binary image according to the formulae:
1)c=adaptivethreshold(b,2,"ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C","THRESH_BINARY",3, 2);
b is gray scale image //this function is 
2 is double maxValue,
ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C is  int adaptiveMethod 
THRESH_BINARY is int thresholdType
3 is int blockSize
2 is  double C
